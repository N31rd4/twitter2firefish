Setup cookies.json and Data.json
Data.json needs to have the twitter user id as a key and an api token with drive write and note create/delete permissions
This is a quickly made prototype
I didn't use nitter technique with graphql request with guest token because i wanted to be able to retreive my private account tweets
but there is a HUGE downside because the api rate limitation is quite high
